"""FastAPI app exposing the full Oransim causal digital-twin stack.

Previously a 1700-line god-file. Endpoints now live in
``oransim.api_routers``; the heavy runtime singletons live in
``oransim.api_state``. This module keeps only the FastAPI instance,
CORS config, lifespan hook, the ``/`` health check, and the
router-include wiring.

    process-local ``api_state`` / ``embedding_bus.BUS`` singletons. Each
    gunicorn / uvicorn worker therefore holds its own independent copy:
    boot time × N, no cross-worker consistency (a sandbox scenario created
    on worker A is invisible on worker B), and memory × N.

    A shared-state backend (Redis / a single "runtime" worker fronted by
    in-process queues) is Enterprise-only in v0.2. Until it lands in OSS,
    single-worker is the correct deployment for the OSS tier. We surface
    a loud WARNING rather than silently letting the operator hit
    surprising cross-request inconsistency in production.
